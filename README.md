# Robot-arm-control-using-machine-vision
I did this project to learn about controlling robots and about computer vision. I built a barebones library for handling controlling the robot and robot related events, and built a library for object tracking and video related events, and a library in the middle to combine them both and stack jenga blocks as well!


This library should be useful for any program that moves more or less like my robot, and can move to a location using stretch, height, and rotational positions and figure everything out from there.

For those interested in the computer vision part, check out Main and Vision. For those interested in the handling of robot events, check out Main and Robot. 


I'll get some documentation in later! I should have built this using github from the beginnning, I know I know.
