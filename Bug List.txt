Bug list:



When the robot is unplugged, the robot will freeze during "waitForRobot" statements

When entering a value on the xy polar coordinate things, it won't handle getting any strings without causing an error and making me force restart

When clicking and dragging a target on the screen, if there are no keypoints there, the program will freeze.




#BUGS WITH PICKING STUFF UP:

Sometimes the robot will fail to actually pluck the object up (or be slightly off center...)

Robot will get too close to object and lose track of it
    MOve up to search
    Pan left/right to search

Robot gets stuck going left/right over and over during focusing function.

Make it so that the robot updates the "last known focused position" of the 'marker' block every time it places a block.
